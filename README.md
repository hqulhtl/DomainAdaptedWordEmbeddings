# DomainAdaptedWordEmbeddings
This repository contains a sample script to learn CCA/KCCA projected DA word embeddings as 
described in our paper "Domain Adapted Word Embeddings for Improved Sentiment Analysis".
Note the our KCCA module was based on Pyrcca. Please make sure to cite our paper [1] and 
Pyrcca[2] when using this code.
